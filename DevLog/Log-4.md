**Day 5 - Across the Nintendo-Verse**

So now that we have a Star in the scene, we need it to shoot Astro Bot into the world of Nintendo

After he's launched, I want to show a scene where he's traveling from one universe to another; which reminded me of a scene from Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse

**Unity3D:** Found some tutorials on how to create a tunnel effect, so here's a comparision between the movie and what i did so far

Next To Do: Recreate this scene to show the path being traveled
