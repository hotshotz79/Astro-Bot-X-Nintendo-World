Been using Unity3D for over 10 years; learned C# just to make games.

After a long break, decided to go back to Unity3D to work on my next project **Astro Bot X Nintendo World** (ABxNW) for the PS4/PS5.

Idea is to make Astro Bot jump into a different universe where he will explore and meet characters from Nintendo.

So to begin my development blog, after a week of re-learning the basic of Unity3D, this is what I achieved.

**Day1:**
* Created background wallpaper

* Unity3D: applied a generic character controller (Note: the new Input System does not work on PS5)
* Blender: Extracted Goomba + Animation from Super Mario Odyssey
* Unity3D: simple script to move the Goomba on Transform-Z
* Unity3D: Added a flat image of Princess Peach Castle; as an idea/reminder to work on next
