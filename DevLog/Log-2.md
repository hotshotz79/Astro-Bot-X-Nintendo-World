**Day 3 - Peaches**

Love the music since N64 days, so thought of having Astro Bot travel to Princess Peach's castle... but before I figure that out, I decided to grab a 3d model + music and have Astro Bot walk around


Asset: Castle model found at Model Resource site
Music: Castl song found at KHInsider video game music

The scene from previous day was upgraded from a 'Plane' and 'Flat Image' into a proper 3D Model... lets call it an HD remake
